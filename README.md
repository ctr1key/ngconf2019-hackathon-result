# ngconf2019-hackathon-result
Uploaded project I used for the ngconf 2019 hackathon for archival purposes. It likely will not run anymore if the hackathon http endpoints are no longer available.

If you did want to edit and run it, one of the dependencies uses C++ and require "npm install --global windows-build-tools" to install.

Also uploaded visualization of the largest route under 44-cesium.txt. It can be used in https://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Build/Apps/Sandcastle/.
